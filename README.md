Cheats		: 

When you are in the Inventory screen, the following key works:

		  [1] Generate a random tier 1 rarity Module
		  [2] Generate a random tier 2 rarity Module
		  [3] Generate a random tier 3 rarity Module
		  [4] Generate a random tier 4 rarity Module
		  [5] Generate a random tier 5 rarity Module
		  [6] Generate a random tier 6 rarity Module
		  [F] Generate a random Module with random attributes
		  
With the above cheats, it is easy to get unlimited resources by selling
the modules (Scrap [S]).

Gameplay Info 	:

		- Your objective is to reach the end (Citadel) before your time (Days) run out.

		- Travelling cost Fuel and Days, so manage them well to reach the end.

		- Explore will help you in earning Equipments (Modules) and Resources (R) that
		  will help you reach the end (Citadel). 

		- In the Inventory system, there is a Maintenance tab that allows conversion
		  of Resources(R) into either Fuel or Hull.
		
		- The ending of the game is determined by your quests (Karma). The endings are 
		  determined by Karma as such:
					1) Neutral (24 to -24)
					2) Paragon ( >= 25)
					3) Renegade ( <= -25)

		- Equipping Modules will provide you with new Abilities to use in battle. The 
		  Abilities provided by the Modules are determined based on the current overall
		  status and the abilities you have equipped. (Rare-er Modules = better skills)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gameplay Tips	:
		
		- Modules will modify the following attributes:

				1) Hull 	: Spaceship's HP
				2) Engine	: Fuel efficiency decides how much fuel you 
						  will use when travelling.
				3) Attack	: Spaceship's Damage in battle
				4) Speed	: Distance you will cover with each travel
				5) Flee Rate	: The chance of escaping battles unharmed
				6) Lucky Find	: The chance of picking up better rarity 
						  modules

		- Modules dropped from loot are determined based on what you have equipped, so
		  the more you equip the better your chance on getting next tier rarity. This 
		  is also adjusted by the Lucky Find chance.

				- If you equip 4 of the same rarity, the next loot dropped
				  will be a better rarity. (Assuming you have 100% lucky find)		

		- Enemies are determined based on the overall strength of the Player. If you 
		  keep focussing on Modules that do not provide combat help, you will still be 
		  face extremely difficult enemies. BALANCE YOUR SHIP.

		- The Planets provide encounters based on the current status of your Spaceship,
		  the lower your resources and your Spaceship's Hull, the better chance of you
		  recieving loot drops.
		
		- 2 of the 3 endings are boss fights, be prepared! The game is more fun if either 
		  Reputation endings are achieved, as you get to fight the end game boss.

HOW TO WIN THE GAME   :

		- Explore as much planets as you can before travelling. Travelling takes a number of days,
		  exploring does not. Use this to your advantage to find modules to either increase your
		  battle effectiveness or ship travel effectiveness. 
		- Balance of your stats is necessary. Every Module will decrease your fuel efficiency, while
		  every other Module will have negative attributes along with its bonuses. 
				- To win battles: Get Weapon and Hull Modules, however this will greatly decrease 
				  your travel capabilities.
				- To get better loot: Equip Radar modules
				- To reach the Citadel Station without dying: Get Boosters and Gliders Module, along
				  along with Engine upgrade to reduce the unit of fuel consumed.

Known Bugs	: 
        
        1. The game is still VERY unbalanced, you might be able to beat it if you know
		      the attributes and abilities well. But use the Cheats if needed to play through.
			  
			  2. The game will say that you have collected XXX Module, but you have YYY Module instead. This is 
			  a bug with the procedural, random module generation, with the random algorithm being bugged.
			  
			  3. When the game is restarted (i.e. without exiting the application), most of the screen elements
			  will be bugged out.
			  
			  4. INVENTORY BUG: You have to equip modules in the EQUIPPED window SEQUENTIALLY. 
          NOTE: SEQUENTIALLY.
			    Just for the first time to initialise the equipment properly. For example, if you equipped a 
          module on the 2-5 equipment slot for the first time, you will equip the module but it will not 
          appear in the display.
